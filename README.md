A little assortment of some code I wrote for school that I could both find on my computer and remember what it does. The school files might be a bit cluttered as I 
purposely included testing and makefiles for my own records. 
The other code is a few scritps I wrote to make my work at deploy easier. It will probably be a bit messier as I wrote them entirely for myself and didn't think anyone 
would ever look at them.
